            that were to work together to develop this page. This was a final class for my IT degree and was difficult at times but gave needed experience
            in working with a team professionally. I will use screen grabs and the website to display what I incorporated and display what were the biggest challenges.

        <div class="grid-item-project"><p class="reflection"><a id="target2">One of my </a> goals is to get a job in the cyber security field. I will display my qualifications and skills related to the goal. 
            I will use my resume and experience with VMs and Linux to display competencies within the field. I will also explain the important of passwords
            and incorporating the use of a password manager.</p></div>

            that ensured the company was up to date on security protocols, with me overseeing the functionality of our “Protect this house” button. I will 
            show my competencies in software used at the company, and speak on my growth there as an employee, with the constant influx of knowledge needing 
            to be acquired to not fall behind at the job. </p></div>
