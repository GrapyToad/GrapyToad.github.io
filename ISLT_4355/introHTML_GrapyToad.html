    Hello, I am Grady Todd and I am a senior majoring in Information Technology. 
    I have an emphasis in cyber security and I am 6 credits short of officially graduating, so I am taking two classes over the summer. 
    I am currently an intern at Veterans United Home Loans, so I am trying to determine what I will be doing after this summer, more specifically searching for a full time position at VU or a different company.
    Things that I enjoy doing in my free time include playing video-games and watching shows such as Arcane or Breaking Bad.
    I also play games such as Super Smash Brothers competitively, and play the card game Magic: The Gathering. 
    I have taken one Information Systems and Learning Technologies class before this one, so I am excited to see what I will learn in this class in comparison to the one I took last semester.
