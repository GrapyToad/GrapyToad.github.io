<main>
    <p>
        I am a graduate from the <em>University of Missouri</em> with a bachelor’s degree in <em>Information Technology</em>.
        I also acquired my cyber security certificate for completing the needed coursework in cyber security.
        I have a down to earth learning method, where being shown is the best way for me to absorb the information.<br>
        <br>
        I am currently interning at <b>Veterans United Home Loans</b>, where I am part of the Incident Response team in security.
        I oversee monitoring reported emails and searching them to ensure that there is nothing malicious
        within them. With the education and work experience, I have collected skills such as working with virtual
        machines, sandboxes, coding in various languages such as Python and HTML, and working with teams of
        individuals, making me realize I am more of a team player than I had thought.
