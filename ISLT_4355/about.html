    Yo, this is Grady. How are my coding buddies doing?
    My question so far is how old are you guys? This class seems to have plenty of older people than me, being that I'm only 22.

                About Me
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a graduate from the <em>University of Missouri</em> with a bachelor’s degree in <em>Information Technology</em>.
                I also acquired my cyber security certificate for completing the needed coursework in cyber security.
                I have a down to earth learning method, where being shown is the best way for me to absorb the information.<br>
                <br>
                I am currently interning at <b>Veterans United Home Loans</b>, where I am part of the Incident Response team in security.
                I oversee monitoring reported emails and searching them to ensure that there is nothing malicious
                within them. With the education and work experience, I have collected skills such as working with virtual
                machines, sandboxes, coding in various languages such as Python and HTML, and working with teams of
                individuals, making me realize I am more of a team player than I had thought.
