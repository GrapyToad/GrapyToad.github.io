            I am currently looking for a full-time position. I am looking between companies such as Veterans United Home Loans and Cerner or newly changed to Oracle. Both
            pique my interest, since location does not mean the most to me. I would like to either stay in Columbia or move to Kansas City. Many people that I already know are in
            Columbia or Kansas City, so I am now working on finding a position in either of these locations. This page shows what I have done thus far in my professional career.

            I began at the University of Missouri undeclared and found a home in Information Technology. I was unsure where to go, but my constant problem-solving
            and wanting to keep up to date on new software allowed me to venture to IT. My freshman year was filled with new coursework, between gen eds and the
            core curriculum for IT. This year let me feel out if I really wanted to pursue this field of education.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">
            My following years led me to adjust to IT with some difficult but interesting courses on the way. Sticking to the program, 
            I found myself at my senior year with my senior capstone looming over me. This was a way that the school could see me put my education to the test, and I 
            had a team with me to develop a website to show the faculty. Through hard work and communication, we finished the project and could stand by something that 
            we felt proud of. This was a great way to end my college career, as it gave me experience with working with teams.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">
            After graduation, I began an internship at Veterans United Home Loans. I was tasked on the security team to help the incident response team. 
            I viewed reported emails and determined if they held malicious content or if they were good to open and view. This could easily relate and help me acquire a 
            job in the security field in the future, something that is a personal goal of mine. After going to the University of Missouri for Information Technology, a 
            job in cyber security would be the most rewarding thing that I could receive.
