            Hey, I’m Grady Todd and I’m a University of Missouri graduate in the field of Information Technology. I am searching for hiring opportunities in the field 
            of Information Technology and Cyber Security, but I am open to any and all experiences to further my education in technology.
        </h3>
        <p>
            This website is for my portfolio to be displayed. This will contain all my experiences and past projects that I have worked on. It will also give a look into 
my hobbies and interests, something that will make me more personable. Attempting to find a comfortable mix between professional and personal content, this portfolio 
will be a sneak-peak into myself. Some goals of this website are to show my personality and experiences, while also showing my work ethic and some things that I 
am passionate about. Hopefully when someone views it, they will be able to view my resume and determine where I have been and done, and that will lead to them 
reaching out or getting back to me about an application.
